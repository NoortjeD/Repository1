			<p><strong>General Reflection</strong></p>
			<p>This semester I didn't have a lot of leadership tasks. I was the producer for my Free Elective project, but that was about it. Though looking at the feedback I have gotten for that project, it looks like I did a good job (and it feels like it too). Besides that, I have taken some responsibility in some assignments. Responsibility is obviously an important characteristic for leadership. <br>So generally, with the leadership opportunities I had, I think I did well. I am not sure if I improved this skill though.</p>

			<p>I think I was pretty flexible this semester, especially during this crazy time of COVID-19. Everyone's entire routine has changed, but I think I picked it up very well. Not without a struggle, but I managed to continue working on my assignments and get good grades so far.</p>

			<p>"(You were) definitely (flexible), if we need to reschedule on the same day, no problem. If things run a little late, no problem. You make some time. Very flexible. If I have to be the devil’s advocate then I could say that its easy to read off your face when you don’t like the changes happening suddenly, but that’s such a small thing. I was doubting to even put it in.."</p>

			<p>I don’t think I improved these skills. But considering the circumstances, I think I did alright. I’ve had multiple setbacks through the semester, which all lead me to be behind on work, tired, and very impatient. This showed in my leadership style. Looking at the feedback I got, it impacted some of my peers, but not all. It will not be easy to get back on track, but it’s already going better now than before Christmas Break.</p>

			<p><strong>General Reflection</strong></p>
			<p>In the beginning of this semester, this went very well. I was flexible. Though as I mentioned before, lots of ‘setbacks’ were adding up to the point where I just weren’t able to think positively about certain changes. Though I adapted, because I still could see the consequences of what would happen if I didn’t. Looking at the feedback from my peers, I was more flexible than I initially thought. If I’d listen to them, I could say that I did achieve this goal.</p>

			<p>In the beginning of the year, I was placed in the publishing department for Production House. This was my third choice and I was really disappointed and sad that I got placed in this department because I didn’t get to practice the skills I wanted to practice. In the first two weeks I was honestly mad. But after that, I decided to change my mood. Because it doesn’t help anyone to stay mad.<br>I am really proud of myself that I could change my mindset like that, but I still need to learn how to do that faster.</p>
